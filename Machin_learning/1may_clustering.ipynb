For example, if a class only makes up a small percentage of the data, then a model that always predicts the majority class will have a high accuracy, even if it is not very accurate at predicting the minority class.\n",

Accuracy does not take this into account, so it can be misleading in this case.\n",

Precision measures the fraction of correctly classified positive instances, while recall measures the fraction of positive instances that were correctly classified. F1 score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it is often used as a single measure of classification performance.\n",
