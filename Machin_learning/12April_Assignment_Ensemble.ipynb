    "### Bagging reduce overfitting in decision trees:\n",
    "Bagging is a technique used to reduce overfitting in decision trees by creating multiple decision tree models on different subsets of the training data and combining them to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By using different subsets of the training data, bagging helps to reduce the variance of the model, which is a common cause of overfitting in decision trees. This is because decision trees can be highly sensitive to the specific data points in the training set, and creating multiple models on different subsets of the data can help to smooth out these variations and produce more stable and generalizable predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specifically, bagging works by randomly sampling the training data with replacement to create multiple \"bootstrap\" samples of the same size as the original training set. Each bootstrap sample is then used to train a separate decision tree model, which is allowed to grow to its full depth without pruning. When making a prediction, all of the individual decision tree models are combined by taking the average prediction for regression problems or a majority vote for classification problems. This ensemble of models can produce a more robust and accurate prediction than any single model on its own."

    "        Base learners with high complexity, such as decision trees, can have low bias but high variance. By averaging the predictions of multiple decision trees in bagging, the variance can be reduced, resulting in a model with lower overall variance and higher generalization performance.\n",

    "The ensemble size is an important hyperparameter in bagging that determines the number of base learners used to generate the ensemble. The role of the ensemble size is to balance the tradeoff between the bias and variance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Here are some key points to consider regarding the ensemble size in bagging:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increasing the ensemble size can reduce the variance of the model: As the number of base learners in the ensemble increases, the variance of the model decreases, leading to a more stable and robust model. This is because the average of multiple predictions is likely to be more accurate than a single prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a diminishing returns effect: After a certain point, adding more base learners to the ensemble does not significantly improve the performance of the model, and may even decrease it. This is because the reduction in variance becomes smaller as the number of base learners increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computational cost: The ensemble size also affects the computational cost of training and evaluating the model. As the ensemble size increases, the computational cost increases proportionally.\n",
