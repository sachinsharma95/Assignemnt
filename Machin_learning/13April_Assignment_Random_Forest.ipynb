    "- Random Forest Regressor is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that is commonly used for regression tasks. It is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees and uses their collective predictions to make a final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   In a Random Forest Regressor, a collection of decision trees are created, each using a random subset of the features in the training data. This helps to reduce overfitting and improves the accuracy of the final predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random Forest Regressor is a powerful and flexible algorithm that can handle a wide range of data types and variable interactions. It is commonly used in various applications, including finance, marketing, and healthcare, where predicting a continuous numerical value is essential.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Subset of Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "    During the construction of each decision tree in the Random Forest, only a random subset of features is considered for each node. This means that each tree is built using a different set of features, which helps to ensure that no single feature dominates the model and that each tree focuses on different aspects of the data.\n",

    "- Bagging: \n",
    "\n",
    "   Random Forest Regressor uses a technique called bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating), which involves randomly sampling the training data with replacement to create multiple datasets. This process helps to reduce the impact of outliers and ensures that the trees are not biased towards any particular part of the dataset.\n",

    "- Ensemble Learning: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The final prediction of a Random Forest Regressor is based on the average of the predictions of all the decision trees in the forest. This ensemble approach helps to reduce the variance in the model, as the errors of individual trees tend to cancel out each other.\n",

    " suppose we have a Random Forest Regressor model with 10 decision trees. If we want to predict the output value for a new input, we pass the input through each of the 10 decision trees, and each tree predicts an output value. The final prediction of the Random Forest Regressor is then the average of these 10 output values."

    "##### Overfitting: \n",
