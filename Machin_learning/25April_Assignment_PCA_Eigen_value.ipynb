    "- The spectral theorem states that a square matrix is diagonalizable if and only if it has a complete set of n linearly independent eigenvectors. This theorem is significant in the context of the Eigen-Decomposition approach because it provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a matrix to be diagonalizable using this method.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagonalizability of a matrix is related to its eigenvalues and eigenvectors because the eigenvalues represent the scaling factors by which the eigenvectors are transformed under multiplication by the matrix. If the matrix has a full set of linearly independent eigenvectors, then any vector in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenvectors, and the action of the matrix on that vector can be computed by scaling each eigenvector by its corresponding eigenvalue and summing the results.\n",

    "- Next, we find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue. For lambda1 = 1, we solve the system (A - lambda1I)x = 0 to get the eigenvector v1 = [1, -1]. For lambda2 = 3, we solve (A - lambda2I)x = 0 to get the eigenvector v2 = [1, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can verify that the eigenvectors are orthogonal by computing their dot product: v1 dot v2 = 0. This means that the matrix A is diagonalizable.\n",

    "In this example, we can see that the matrix A is diagonalizable because it has a full set of linearly independent eigenvectors, and the diagonal matrix that results from the transformation has the eigenvalues of A along the diagonal.
