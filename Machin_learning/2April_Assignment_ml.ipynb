        "Grid search CV (Cross-validation) is a hyperparameter optimization technique that is commonly used in machine learning to fine-tune the model's performance. It automates the process of selecting the optimal hyperparameters that maximize the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",

We can create a grid with different values for each hyperparameter, such as [0.001, 0.01, 0.1] for the learning rate, [1, 2, 3] for the number of hidden layers, and [16, 32, 64] for the number of neurons in each layer.
