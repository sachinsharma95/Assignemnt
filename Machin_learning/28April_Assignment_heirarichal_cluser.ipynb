    "Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that groups data points into clusters based on their similarity. The algorithm works by creating a hierarchy of clusters, starting with each data point in its own cluster and then merging clusters that are similar to each other. Hierarchical clustering is different from other clustering techniques in that it does not require the user to specify the number of clusters in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical clustering can be either **agglomerative** or **divisive**. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering starts with each data point in its own cluster and then merges clusters that are similar to each other. Divisive hierarchical clustering starts with all data points in one cluster and then splits clusters that are dissimilar to each other.\n",

    "Hierarchical clustering is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. Some of the most common applications of hierarchical clustering include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Customer segmentation:** Hierarchical clustering can be used to segment customer data into groups of customers with similar characteristics. This information can be used to target marketing campaigns, develop new products and services, and improve customer service.\n",
    "* **Market basket analysis:** Hierarchical clustering can be used to identify groups of products that are often purchased together. This information can be used to improve product placement in stores, develop cross-selling and upselling strategies, and create targeted marketing campaigns.\n",
    "* **Text mining:** Hierarchical clustering can be used to cluster text documents into groups of documents with similar topics. This information can be used to improve search results, identify trends in social media data, and extract insights from large corpora of text.\n",
    "* **Image segmentation:** Hierarchical clustering can be used to segment images into groups of pixels with similar properties. This information can be used to improve image quality, remove noise, and extract features from images.\n",
    "* **Gene expression analysis:** Hierarchical clustering can be used to cluster gene expression data into groups of genes with similar expression patterns. This information can be used to identify genes that are co-expressed, identify disease biomarkers, and develop new treatments for diseases.\n",

    "- A dendrogram is a tree-like diagram that shows the hierarchy of clusters created by a hierarchical clustering algorithm. The branches of the dendrogram represent the clusters, and the distance between two branches represents the distance between the two clusters. Dendrograms are useful for visualizing the results of hierarchical clustering and for identifying the optimal number of clusters.\n",

    "* To read a dendrogram, start at the bottom and work your way up. The bottom of the dendrogram represents each data point as its own cluster. As you move up the dendrogram, clusters are merged together. The height at which two clusters are merged represents the distance between the two clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The optimal number of clusters is the point at which the dendrogram branches off into multiple clusters. This point can be identified by looking for a \"knee\" in the dendrogram. The knee is the point at which the distance between the clusters starts to increase rapidly.\n",

You can also use domain knowledge to determine if the outliers make sense.\n",
